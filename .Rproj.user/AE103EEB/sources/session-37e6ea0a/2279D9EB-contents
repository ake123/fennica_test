Storing CSV files in Git, especially if they are large or frequently
updated, can lead to challenges such as repository bloat, slow cloning
and pulling times, and difficulties in handling merge conflicts. Here
are several strategies to manage or mitigate these issues by storing CSV
files elsewhere:

1.  **Git Large File Storage (LFS):** Git LFS replaces large files, such
    as CSV files, with short pointer files in the Git repository, while
    storing the file contents on a remote server. This is an excellent
    option if you need to track the file history but want to avoid
    bloating the repository with large files.

2.  **External Storage Services:** Store your CSV files on external
    cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or
    Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You can reference these files in your
    repository through URLs or by including a manifest file in your
    repository that lists the locations of the CSV files. This approach
    is useful for very large datasets or binary files that do not
    benefit from version control.

3.  **Data Version Control Systems:** Tools like DVC (Data Version
    Control) are designed to handle large data files and machine
    learning models. DVC works alongside Git to manage data files and
    models efficiently without storing the data itself in the Git
    repository. It allows you to version control your data and models in
    a way that is similar to how Git versions source code.

4.  **Submodules and Subtrees:** If your CSV files must remain within a
    Git environment, consider using Git submodules or subtrees to store
    them in a separate repository. This allows you to keep your main
    repository lightweight while still maintaining a link to the data
    stored elsewhere.

5.  **Database Solutions:** For data that is frequently updated or needs
    to be queried, consider using a database. This could be a
    traditional SQL database, a NoSQL database, or a cloud-based
    database as a service (DBaaS). Storing data in a database instead of
    flat CSV files can improve performance, scalability, and data
    integrity.

6.  **Artifact Repositories:** Artifact repositories like JFrog
    Artifactory or Nexus Repository can be used to store binary
    artifacts, including CSV files. These tools offer version control
    for artifacts, which can be a good fit for datasets that need to be
    versioned but are not suitable for storage directly in Git.

7.  **Documentation and Access Control:** Regardless of where you store
    your CSV files, ensure you document their locations and how to
    access them. If you're using cloud storage or databases, also
    consider access control and security to protect your data.

Each of these strategies has its advantages and considerations,
depending on the size of the data, the frequency of updates, and your
specific workflow requirements. It's important to choose the option that
best fits your project's needs and to document the chosen strategy for
team members.
